## Introducing

Assuming that you are familiar with the CoreMedia Studio and that you created a
new article which should be published at a certain time in the future or 
the article should be sent to another editor for review who will then forward it 
to publication to a third editor. This guide shows how this task can be accomplished
by means of the publication workflow extensions.

### Start the Workflow
After having completed a new article you can start publication workflows using 
the context menu on the document as shown here:

### Schedule the Publication
Choose the _Schuduled Publication_ from the list of _Workflow Type_ and select the
_Scheduled Date_. Click on _Start_ to start the workflow instance.

### Monitor the Scheduled Publication
While the scheduled publication is yet pending it is listed under the pending workflows.
A scheduled publication workflow instance hat the specific timer icon.
Notice that as long as it is pending the document is locked so that it cannot be edited.

By clicking on the workflow instance you get the details of the workflow. Escpecially
you can see the scheduled date of the publication.
